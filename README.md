## 📝 Contribution Guidelines
Before editing any code or other files, **please notify the group** first to avoid conflicts.  

### 🚀 Before Editing:
1. **Inform the group** about the changes you’re planning to make.  
2. **Make sure you are working in your branch** — do NOT commit directly to the `main` branch.  
   - I noticed someone committed to the `main` branch earlier — please avoid doing this.

### 🛠️ When Making a Commit:
- Include a clear **summary** in the commit description.  
- Mention **which PHP files** you modified.  
- Example:  
   > _"Added notifications to `homepage.php`"_

### 🔄 After Committing:
1. **Push your commit** to the origin branch.  
2. After pushing, click **"View on GitHub"** at the bottom of GitHub Desktop.  
3. Make sure you are still on your branch.  
4. Click **"This branch is 1 commit ahead"** → **"Create Pull Request."**

### ✅ When Creating a Pull Request:
- **Read and answer** the "Changes Proposed" section before submitting the request.  
- For the **title**:
   - State which PHP files you modified.  
   - Example: _"Updated homepage.php – Added Notifications"_  
- For the **description**:
   - Clearly explain the changes made.  
   - Example: _"Added a notifications section to `homepage.php` for better user engagement."_
